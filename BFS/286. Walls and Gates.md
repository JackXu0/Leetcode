#### 286. Walls and Gates

You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

- `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
- `0` A gate.
- `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to *its nearest gate*. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/03/grid.jpg)

```
Input: rooms = [[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
Output: [[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rooms = [[-1]]
Output: [[-1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == rooms.length`
- `n == rooms[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 250`
- `rooms[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `231 - 1`.



**My Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
        """
        m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        queue_set = set()
        # find all gates
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                    queue_set.add((i, j))
                    
        #BFS
        distance = 0
        directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        while queue_set:
            queue = list(queue_set)
            for (x, y) in queue:
                rooms[x][y] = min(rooms[x][y], distance)
                for [dx, dy] in directions:
                    nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                    if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and rooms[nx][ny] == 2147483647:
                        if (nx, ny) not in queue_set:
                            queue_set.add((nx, ny))
                queue_set.remove((x,y))
            distance += 1
```
