#### 1905. Count Sub Islands

You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only `0`'s (representing water) and `1`'s (representing land). An **island** is a group of `1`'s connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.

An island in `grid2` is considered a **sub-island** if there is an island in `grid1` that contains **all** the cells that make up **this** island in `grid2`.

Return the ***number** of islands in* `grid2` *that are considered **sub-islands***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]
Output: 2 
Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid1.length == grid2.length`
- `n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `grid1[i][j]` and `grid2[i][j]` are either `0` or `1`.



**My code:**

```python
    def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        islands = []
        directions = [[1,0], [-1,0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        
        def dfs(i, j):
            grid2[i][j] = 0
            islands[-1].append((i, j))
            for direction in directions:
                ni, nj = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
                if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and grid2[ni][nj] == 1:
                    dfs(ni, nj)
                    
        m, n = len(grid1), len(grid1[0])
        # find all islands in grid2
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid2[i][j] == 1:
                    islands.append([])
                    dfs(i, j)
                    
        res = 0
        # check eligibility for each island
        for island in islands:
            eligible = True
            for (i, j) in island:
                if grid1[i][j] == 0:
                    eligible = False
                    break
                    
            if eligible:
                res += 1
                
        return res
```

**A different approach:**

```python
def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    
    m=len(grid1)
    n=len(grid1[0])
    
    def dfs(i,j):
        if i<0 or i>=m or j<0 or j>=n or grid2[i][j]==0:
            return
        
        grid2[i][j]=0
        dfs(i+1,j)
        dfs(i,j+1)
        dfs(i,j-1)
        dfs(i-1,j)
        
    # removing all the non-common sub-islands
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid2[i][j]==1 and grid1[i][j]==0:
                dfs(i,j)
    
    c=0
	# counting sub-islands
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid2[i][j]==1:
                dfs(i,j)
                c+=1
    return c
```
