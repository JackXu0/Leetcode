#### 1391. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid

You are given an `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:

- `1` which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
- `2` which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
- `3` which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
- `4` which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
- `5` which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
- `6` which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0, 0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell `(0, 0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. **The path should only follow the streets**.

**Notice** that you are **not allowed** to change any street.

Return `true` *if there is a valid path in the grid or* `false` *otherwise*. 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e2.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`



**My code:**

```python
    def hasValidPath(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        mmap = {}
        mmap[1] = {(1, 0, -1), (1, 0, 1), (3, 0, 1), (4, 0, -1), (5, 0, 1), (6, 0, -1)}
        mmap[2] = {(2, -1, 0), (2, 1, 0), (3, -1, 0), (4, -1, 0), (5, 1, 0), (6, 1, 0)}
        mmap[3] = {(1, 0, -1), (2, 1, 0), (4, 0, -1), (5, 1, 0), (6, 1, 0), (6, 0, -1)}
        mmap[4] = {(1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0), (3, 0, 1), (5, 1, 0), (5, 0, 1), (6, 1, 0)}
        mmap[5] = {(1, 0, -1), (2, -1, 0), (3, -1, 0), (4, 0, -1), (4, -1, 0), (6, 0, -1)}
        mmap[6] = {(1, 0, 1), (2, -1, 0), (3, 0, 1), (3, -1, 0), (4, -1, 0), (5, 0, 1)}
        
        m ,n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        if m == 1 and n == 1:
            return True
        queue = [[0, 0]]
        visited = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        visited[0][0] = True
        while queue:
            [i, j] = queue.pop(0)
            for v, di, dj in mmap[grid[i][j]]:
                if i+di == m-1 and j+dj == n-1 and grid[i+di][j+dj] == v:
                    return True
                if 0 <= i+di < m and 0 <= j+dj < n and grid[i+di][j+dj] == v and not visited[i+di][j+dj]:
                    queue.append([i+di, j+dj])
                    visited[i+di][j+dj] = True
                    
        return False
```

**Another approach:**

```python
def hasValidPath(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        DIRECTIONS = {
            1: [(0, -1), (0, 1)],
            2: [(-1, 0), (1, 0)],
            3: [(0, -1), (1, 0)],
            4: [(0, 1), (1, 0)],
            5: [(0, -1), (-1, 0)],
            6: [(0, 1), (-1, 0)]
        }
        
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        def isValidMove(r,c): 
            return r < ROWS and r >= 0 and c < COLS and c >= 0 and (r,c) not in visited
        
        
        q = deque([(0,0)])
        visited = set()
        while q:
            r,c = q.pop()
            
            if r == ROWS - 1 and c == COLS - 1:
                return True

            visited.add((r,c))
            s = grid[r][c]

            for dr, dc in DIRECTIONS[s]:
                nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                if isValidMove(nr,nc):
                    ns = grid[nr][nc]
                    if (-dr,-dc) in DIRECTIONS[ns]:
                        q.append((nr, nc))

        return False
```
