#### 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their **common interest** with the **least list index sum**. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30`
- `list1[i]` and `list2[i]` consist of spaces `' '` and English letters.
- All the stings of `list1` are **unique**.
- All the stings of `list2` are **unique**.



**My code:**

```python
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        mmap1 = {}
        for i in range(len(list1)):
            mmap1[list1[i]] = i
            
        candidates = {}
        for i in range(len(list2)):
            if list2[i] in mmap1:
                candidates[list2[i]] = mmap1[list2[i]] + i
                
        min_index_sum = min(candidates.values())
        res = []
        for k in candidates.keys():
            if candidates[k] == min_index_sum:
                res.append(k)
            
        return res
```

**Clean version:**

```python
    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):
        dict1 = {rest : i for i, rest in enumerate(list1)}
        dict2 = {rest : i for i, rest in enumerate(list2)}
        dictSum = {rest : dict1[rest]+dict2[rest] for rest in dict1 if rest in dict2}
        minSum = min(dictSum.values())
        return [key for key in dictSum if dictSum[key] == minSum]
```
