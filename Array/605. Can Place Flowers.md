#### 605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return *if* `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`



**My code:**

```python
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        spots = 0
        i, j = 0, 1
        while j < len(flowerbed) and spots < n:
            while j < len(flowerbed) and flowerbed[j] == 0:
                j += 1
            itv = j - i + 1
            if flowerbed[i] == 1:
                itv -= 2
            if j < len(flowerbed):
                itv -= 2
            else:
                itv -= 1
            spots += max((itv + 1) // 2, 0)
            i = j
            j += 1
            
        if len(flowerbed) == 1 and flowerbed[0] == 0 and n == 1:
            return True
            
        if spots >= n:
            return True
        return False
```

**Solution:**

```python
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0 
        flowerbed = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        
        for i in range(1,len(flowerbed)-1):
            if flowerbed[i] ==0 and flowerbed[i-1] !=1 and flowerbed[i+1] !=1:
                count+=1
                flowerbed[i] =1
                
        return count>=n
```
