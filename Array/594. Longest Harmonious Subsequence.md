#### 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences*.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`



**My code:**

```python
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mmap = defaultdict(int)
        for n in nums:
            mmap[n] += 1
        keys = sorted(mmap.keys())
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(keys)):
            if keys[i] - keys[i-1] == 1:
                res = max(res, mmap[keys[i-1]] + mmap[keys[i]])
            
        return res
```

**Another format:**

```python
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        my_dict = defaultdict(int)
        # keep in dict the number of times each number appears:
        for num in nums:
            my_dict[num]+=1
            
        max_ = 0
        # for each number in dict check if it+its following number is more than previous max:
        for num in my_dict.keys():
            if my_dict.get(num+1):
                max_ = max(max_, my_dict[num] + my_dict.get(num+1))
        return max_
```
