#### 2049. Count Nodes With the Highest Score

There is a **binary** tree rooted at `0` consisting of `n` nodes. The nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `parents` representing the tree, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parents[0] == -1`.

Each node has a **score**. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were **removed**. The tree would become one or more **non-empty** subtrees. The **size** of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The **score** of the node is the **product of the sizes** of all those subtrees.

Return *the **number** of nodes that have the **highest score***.

**Example 1:**

![example-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/03/example-1.png)

```
Input: parents = [-1,2,0,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- The score of node 0 is: 3 * 1 = 3
- The score of node 1 is: 4 = 4
- The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 * 2 = 2
- The score of node 3 is: 4 = 4
- The score of node 4 is: 4 = 4
The highest score is 4, and three nodes (node 1, node 3, and node 4) have the highest score.
```

**Example 2:**

![example-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/03/example-2.png)

```
Input: parents = [-1,2,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The score of node 0 is: 2 = 2
- The score of node 1 is: 2 = 2
- The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 = 1
The highest score is 2, and two nodes (node 0 and node 1) have the highest score.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == parents.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `parents[0] == -1`
- `0 <= parents[i] <= n - 1` for `i != 0`
- `parents` represents a valid binary tree.



**My Code**

```python
class Solution:
    def countHighestScoreNodes(self, parents: List[int]) -> int:
        nodes = {}
        n = len(parents)
        for i in range(len(parents)):
            if i not in nodes:
                nodes[i] = Node(i)
            if parents[i] not in nodes:
                nodes[parents[i]] = Node(parents[i])
              
            curr, p = nodes[i], nodes[parents[i]]
            if not p.left:
                p.left = curr
            else:
                p.right = curr
                
        scores = {}
        cache = {}
        for i in range(len(parents)):
            l, r, cache = nodes[i].getChildrenCount(cache)
            score = 1
            if l > 0:
                score *= l
            if r > 0:
                score *= r
            if (n-l-r-1) > 0:
                score *= (n-l-r-1)
            # print(i, l, r, (n-l-r-1))
            scores[score] = scores.get(score, 0) + 1
            
        # print(scores)
            
        return scores[max(scores.keys())]
              
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        
    def getChildrenCount(self, cache):
        if self.value in cache:
            (l, r) = cache[self.value]
            return l, r, cache
        l, r = 0, 0
        if not self.left:
            l = 0
        else:
            ll, lr, cache = self.left.getChildrenCount(cache)
            l = ll + lr + 1
        if not self.right:
            r = 0
        else:
            rl, rr, cache = self.right.getChildrenCount(cache)
            r = rl + rr + 1
            
        cache[self.value] = (l, r)
            
        return l, r, cache
```

**Solution (post-order dis):**

```python
class Solution:
    def countHighestScoreNodes(self, parents: List[int]) -> int:
        tree = [[] for _ in parents]
        for i, x in enumerate(parents): 
            if x >= 0: tree[x].append(i)
        
        def fn(x): 
            """Return count of tree nodes."""
            count = score = 1
            for xx in tree[x]: 
                cc = fn(xx)
                count += cc
                score *= cc
            score *= len(parents) - count or 1
            freq[score] += 1
            return count
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        fn(0)
        return freq[max(freq)]
```
